This project is part of a Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science.
The purpose of this project was to gain fundamental knowledge in creating machine learning systems using TorchServe or TensorFlow Serving. The entire system was orchestrated using Kubernetes (with a local Minikube setup).
For monitoring, a Prometheus server was used, with Grafana for visualization.
The system was tested using k6.
